learning app for neurodivergent kids and platform for parents to assess their child


Idea:

It are an adaptive learning platform for children with neurodevelopment disorders and learning disabilities (academic challenges) which understands the difficulties of the child and recommends adaptive learning exercises to support their learning at home or school.

Our application uses guidance from experts in each type of disorder ( such as dyslexia (reading), dysgraphia (writing), and dyscalculia (math) ) and combines this guidance with exemplary literature to create our learning exercises for the child. This is complimented with our suggestions for parents to notice behavior patterns for the child to enable them to learn beyond just our platform. This holds the potential to give the child and the parent a happier life with lesser issues as they deal with the learning disorder together.

Our adaptive learning system guides parents through taking inputs on the child's behaviors and learns from the child's performance in our in app exercises. We use Lang Chain and RAG to adapt our exercises and responses by learning from the parents' feedback. Our app understands the childâ€™s journey with more nuance and creates a track to help them learn faster resulting in a more normal lifestyle. 

Our application collates all the information and creates a dashboard for the caregiver to visualize their growth which is critical because this is only validated by a therapist and costs a fortune. ||

What is the biggest problem we solve:

Learning disabilities and neurodevelopment disorders are really expensive to support through clinicians therapists and of course the amount of time spent with the child to help them. Our application supports parents and acts as a partner for them providing support to all who cannot afford consistent therapy or special classes.Our app will enable children to catch up faster with their peers even without expensive classes or constant guidance.
